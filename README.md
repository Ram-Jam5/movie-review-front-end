#### App's Name: We named our app Movie Review. This app helps people to display their favorite movies and interact with a community of people discussing their likes and dislikes about each movie. We chose this app because we are all really big fans of movies.

#### Getting Started: The planning materials we used for this app are on our [trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/66a05c6da3eef27de20edbc2/ATTIa8788d82b23f4e9b6a37cb3ce8ecebcc5A691DAB/group-5-mern-project). Our deployed link for our app can be found [here](). You can also find our back-repository [here](https://github.com/Ram-Jam5/movie-review-back-end). 

#### Technologies used: The principle technologies used: JavaScript, React, CSS.

#### Next Steps: Planned future enhancements for this project are to add the ability for users to add TV Show information and to add more details about Movies and TV shows like the cast and crew.
